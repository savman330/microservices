# Microservices

Going to do a couple/few microservices in this repo.

#### Goals:  
  * To get more familiar with Node/Express
  * Get an alpha version of stable architechture down; obviously its mutable
  * Keep pushing my abilities
  
  
First create a new repo and create a README.md; Init a new repo, add remote (ssh), commit and push README and leggo!

### Timestamp 

Another project [here](https://www.freecodecamp.org/challenges/timestamp-microservice); As stated they pass the parameters driectly through the URL
which is fine and all, but I am going to take it a step further and create a rudimentary dashboard to enter my values.

init a new Node project; add dependancies express and body-parser as per usual; install dev dependancy nodemon b/c it's awesome.
edit package.json to create an alias for nodemon.
```
'scripts': {
    'dev': 'nodemon server.js'
};
```
Yes, yes, I know...focus; but I'm going to back up for a second and get better with my fundamentals by doing the Mozilla
[tutorial](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Express_Nodejs).  This should really get my fundamentals in a better place.
Will be firing up another repo for this as I want to refer to the README as needed.
